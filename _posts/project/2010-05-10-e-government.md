The WV E-Gov inititive was started by the [Community Connect Foundation](http://www.communityconnectfoundation.org/projects.php?id=6) and the [Alliance WV](http://www.alliancewv.org/e-gov_wv.html) with the goal to provide a web precense for all 55 counties in WV. Sharepoint sites were used as a content management system so that student representatives from each county could submit and update content.
